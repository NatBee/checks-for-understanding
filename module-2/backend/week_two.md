## Week Two - Module 2 Recap

Fork this respository. Answer the questions to the best of your ability. Try to answer them with limited amount of external research. These questions cover the majority of what we've learned this week (which is a TON - YOU are a web developer!!!). 

Note: When you're done, submit a PR.

1. At a high level, what is ActiveRecord? What does it do/allow you to do?

ActiveRecord is an object  relational mapper that allows you to relate tables in a database to one another. ActiveRecord has build in methods that allow you to pull data from db tables, create new instances, update instances, and delete instances from a database. It also allows you to relate tables to other tables and access data through those relationships. 
2. Assume you have the following model:

```ruby
class Team << ActiveRecord::Base
end
```

What are some methods you can call on `Team`? If these methods aren't defined in the class, how do you have access to them?

Team.all
Team.count
Team.first
Team.last

These are methods in ActiveRecord.

3. Assume that in your database, a team has the following attributes: "id", "name", owner_id". How would you find the name of a team with an id of 4? Assuming your class only included the code from question 2, how could you find the owner of the same team?
Team.find(4).name
Team.find(4).owner_id

4. Assume that you added a line to your `Team` class as follows:

```ruby
class Team << ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :owner
end
```

Now how would you find the owner of the team with an id of 4?

Owner.where(

5. In a database that's holding students and teachers, what will be the relationship between students and teachers? Draw the schema diagram.

This will be a many to many relationship. Teachers will have many students and students will have mant teachers.

6. Define foreign key, primary key, and schema.

Foreign key -- A primary key inside a table referencing another row in another table.

Primary key -- A unique identifier for a recor in a table.

schema -- Tells you the what is in you database. The tables and the input formats are visible in the schema and everytime you make a change to the database structure it is recored in the schema, The schema tells you the current state of the database.
7. Describe the relationship between a foreign key on one table and a primary key on another table.

If you have 2 tables a Teacher and classroom. The teacher belongs to one classroom but a classroom has many teachers. Each table will have a primary key but the classroom will have a teacher_id which is a foreign key. This will allow the teacher to be accessable by the classroom table.

8. What are the parts of an HTTP response?

The head which includes the administrative control and the body which includes the content.


### Optional Questions

1. Name your five favorite ActiveRecord methods (i.e. methods your models inherit from ActiveRecord) and describe what they do.
2. Name your three favorite ActiveRecord rake tasks and describe what they do.
3. What two columns does `t.timestamps null: false` create in our database?
4. In a database that's holding schools and teachers, what will be the relationship between schools and teachers?
5. In the same database, what will you need to do to create this relationship (draw a schema diagram)?
6. Give an example of when you might want to store information besides ids on a join table.
7. Describe and diagram the relationship between patients and doctors.
8. Describe and diagram the relationship between museums and original_paintings.
9. What could you see in your code that would make you think you might want to create a partial?
